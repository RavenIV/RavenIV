### Glad to see you here! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a beginner Python backend developer from St.Petersburg.

In the summer of 2022, I completed my master's degree in linguistics wanting to pursue a career in interpreting or international relations.
Half a year later I got interested in programming and began developing simple apps on Python which amazed me by its flexibility and closeness to natural languages.
Having realized that nothing but coding excited me so much, I decided to turn my hobby into my profession and completed bootcamp course on Python development.
